# shader-system
attempt to create simple shader demo system with support for rocket. 

# requirements
when running on ubuntu, freeglut and glew are available from package management
- freeGlut http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/
- glew http://glew.sourceforge.net/
- jsoncpp https://github.com/open-source-parsers/jsoncpp
  
# lore
motivation for this is to determine if my old Thinkpad X61 can be used to develop shaders.

i am under impression that this machine is capable of using hardware OpenGL 2.1. best way to verify this is to write simple and small shader program. mostly what should be accompished is to mimic http://glslsandbox.com
